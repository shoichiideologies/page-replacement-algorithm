# Step Algo

A **Page-Replacement Algorithm Visualizer** aims to provide an interactive and educational tool for understanding how different page-replacement algorithms work. It helps users visualize the process of memory management in operating systems by simulating various algorithms such as First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Last Recently Used (LRU), and Optimal (OPT).
